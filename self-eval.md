# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

    Really good. Group 1 really pulled together this weekend to put it all together on these assignments which was very encouraging. I am really excited with how much we have been able to learn and even more excited knowing we are just getting going. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

    It's going well. I am a bit of an all or nothing type of person, so I have been dedicating a lot of time to this but I have been able to hit the pause button. There is so much to learn that I haven't hit many unproductive struggles fortunately. Every error code teaches me just a little bit more. 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

    The different ways attributes vs variables are returned and the different limitations of each of them. The way attributes, variables, methods, and instance methods all work together is going to be something I work on a lot between now and mod 1.
